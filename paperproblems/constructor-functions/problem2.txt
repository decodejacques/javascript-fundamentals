What does this program output?

function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
        console.log("Hello my name is " + this.name);
    }
}

var bob = new Person("Bob", 30);

Person.prototype.leave = function() {return this.name + " is leaving";}

bob.leave();

//output "Bob is leaving" because the property leave is correctly added to the prototype of the function Person
