What does this program output?

function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
        console.log("Hello my name is " + this.name);
    }
}

var bob = Person("Bob", 30);

bob.name = bob.name + " Dole";

bob.greet();

----------------

Well I'd guess..."Hello my name is Bob Dole", but that of course would be wrong because the console.log is being called from the function() which has no damn context.
