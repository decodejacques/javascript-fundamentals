Rewrite this program so that it does't use the new keyword.
The program must be equivalent in every other way.
(You would never do this in production. This is for learning purposes)

function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
        console.log("Hello my name is " + this.name);
    }
}

var bob = new Person("Bob", 30);


function person(name, age) {
    return {fname: name, age: age, greet: function(){console.log("Hello my name is " + name)}}
}

var bob = person('Bob', 30)

var sue = new Person("Sue", 24);
