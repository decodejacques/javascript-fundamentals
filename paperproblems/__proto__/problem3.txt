When you type the following in your developer console:

a = {};
b = {};
a.__proto__ = b;
b.__proto__ = a;

You get the following exception:

    Uncaught TypeError: Cyclic __proto__ value


a) Explain what this exception means.
that there is a loop going from a to b to a to b... so an infinite search for answers.

b) Why does this exception exist? What's wrong with a cyclic __proto__ value?
it will never return anything it will just keep looking.
