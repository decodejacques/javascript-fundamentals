What is the output of this program?

'use strict';

var obj = {
    bar: function(i) {console.log(this.baz + i);},
    baz: 12
}

function f(g) {
    console.log(g(4));
}

f(obj.bar);

-----------

pass obj.bar into f, which tells us to console.log obj.bar(4), which tells us to function (4) (console.log(this.baz + 4), 12+4 is 16, so hopefully this gives me 16...

which of fucking course it doesn't.... which is because it is called from function(i)... which has no . in front of it so the rule says window/error :(
