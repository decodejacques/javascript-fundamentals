What is the output of this program?

'use strict';

function foo() {
    console.log(this.baz);
}

var obj = {bar: foo, baz: 8};
obj.bar();

----------------

would return 8, since obj is before the . so it's called from obj and baz has a value of 8. BUt only because foo is a function, so it runs it and prints baz.
