What is the output of this program?

'use strict';

var bob = {
    name: "Bob",
	introduction: function() {console.log("Hi I'm " + this.name);}
}

var eric = { name: "Eric" };

bob.introduction = bob.introduction.bind(bob);

eric.introduction = bob.introduction;

eric.introduction = eric.introduction.bind({name: "Steve"});

eric.introduction();


----- 
first guess was Steve, I was wrong.

bob.intro is set to bob.intro.bind(bob), then eric is set to bob.intro so it gets bound then and the steve binding fails
