Rewrite this program so that it doesn't have a single function definition
In other words, replace all the function definitions with anonymous functions
The final program should be on a single line


function greet(x) {
    console.log("hello " + x);
}

function call(f) {
    f("bob");
}

call(greet);

(function(f){f("bob");})(function(x){console.log("hello " + x);})
