What does the following program do?

function g() {
    console.log("Hello!")
}

function h() {
    setInterval(g, 1000);
}

setInterval(h, 1000);

--------------
before running it:
repeatedly print hello every 2 seconds?

after running it:
realising that h will repeat every second and call g to ALSO repeat every second which 
it will continuously spawn more interval loops. So by the 60th second we will have ~ 60 intervals looping around printing hello. that was fun.
