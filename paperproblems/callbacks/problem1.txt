What does the following program do?

function g() {
    console.log("Hello!")
}

function f() {
    setTimeout(g, 500);
}

function h() {
    setTimeout(f, 1000);
}

setTimeout(h, 200);


-----------------------
wtf :) callback inception
first guess:
setTimeout Calls h, which calls setTimeout which calls f which calls set Timeout, which calls g which console logs "hello" (right away) returns undefined in a cascading flow of failure all the way back to the start
next guess after running it:
...and realising that h was not h() so passed the funciton and not the result meaning that h waits 200 ms before f waits 1000 ms before g waits 500 ms before printing "Hello!"
