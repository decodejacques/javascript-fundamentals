For each of the following expressions:
 - Does it have a syntax error?
 - If it doesn't have a syntax error, what are the probable input and output types of the function?

a) x => x + 1 // good - x would be a number in and out

b) x, y => x * y // bad 2 params so (x, y) => x* y, again number in and out for types given the *

c) x => { x * 2 } // seems fine, number in and out, don't need the {} though, could be x => x *2

d) (x, z) => {console.log(z); return x * z} // no problem, I would assume input and out put of numbers since console log z could be a string but the x * z would throw an error since you can't multiple strings.

e) x => console.log(z); return x * z // function needs {} since it's a statement, so x => {console.log(z); return x * z;} - gonna assume numbers again becase fo the *

f) (x) => x * 2 // don't need the () since only one param. x => x * 2 , number types again

e) () => console.log("hello") // anonymous nothing in and nothing returned (so implicit undefined)

When you're done, check all your answers in the developer console.
