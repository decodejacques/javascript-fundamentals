var animals = [
    {species: 'dog', name: 'Nacho'},
    {species: 'cat', name: 'Ramses'},
    {species: 'bunny',name: 'Flufftail'},
    {species: 'dog', name: 'Popcorn'},
    {species: 'giraffe', name: 'Neckbeard'},
    {species: 'possum', name: ''}
];

function isDog(animal) {
    return animal.species === 'dog';
}

animals.some(isDog)
animals.every(isDog)


------------------

well we didn't cover some or every in class so as a complete guess.. (nah.. googled it). SO some is if anything in the array returns true, every requires everythign in the array 
to return tre for it to be true ( so kinda like an or/and). So there's nothing in the program to print anythign so I wouldn't get much, but some would return true and every would 
return false.

This would be very useful for the compare arrays for uniques problem :)
