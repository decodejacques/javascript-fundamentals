What is the output of this program?

var animals = [
    {species: 'dog', name: 'Nacho'},
    {species: 'cat', name: 'Ramses'},
    {species: 'bunny',name: 'Flufftail'},
    {species: 'dog', name: 'Popcorn'},
    {species: 'giraffe', name: 'Neckbeard'},
    {species: 'possum', name: ''}
];

var dogs = animals.filter(
                function(animal)
                     {return animal.species === 'dog';});

console.log(dogs.length);

----------------------------

whoa...

ok so, using an anonymous function to filter based on animal species being dog, and adding to the dogs var (seeing as filter is an array function I guess it figures out it's an array). there are two objects within animals array that have dog s a species, so I guess it would return 2
