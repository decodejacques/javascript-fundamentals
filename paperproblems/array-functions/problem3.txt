---------------------

anon function to make a new array called animal Names. it returns animal.name, so id have an array with the 5/6 names.then the console log joins them. so..

NachoRamsesFlufftailPopcornNeckbeard

which coincidentally sounds like a repl file name.

nope... it still has the , inbetween each name. so join() does not join them all as a string, but rather takes each individual array index and puts it into one.
