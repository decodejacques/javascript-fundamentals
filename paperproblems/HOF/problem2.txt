Someone has given you a function called map
You don't know what it does, but there are clues at the bottom of this file
Use these clues to describe what map is.
Specifically:
 - How many parameters does it have
 - What are the types of the parameters
 - What does it do?


Map is a function that takes two parakeets. The first is an array and the second is function. Map will pass each element in array to the function and return the results in a new array. 

var someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var someStrings = ["bob", "ERIC"];

function toUpperCase(x) {
    return x.toUpperCase();
}

function toLowerCase(x) {
    return x.toLowerCase();
}

function double(x) {
    return x * 2;
}

function triple(x) {
    return x * 3;
}

map(someNumbers, double) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
map(someNumbers, triple) => [3, 6, 9, 12]

map(someStrings, toUpperCase) => ["BOB", "ERIC"]
map(someStrings, toLowerCase) => ["bob", "eric"]
