Someone has given you a function called filter
You don't know what it does, but there are clues at the bottom of this file
Use these clues to describe what filter is.
Specifically:
 - How many parameters does it have
two
 - What are the types of the parameters
array, function
 - What does it do?
it takes an array and applies a function which assesses whether or not an element of an array is divisible by itself, depending on if the function returns a boolean of true the element is either passed to a new array using.push or ignored from this new array.

var evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
var oddNumbers = [3, 5, 7, 9];
var someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

function isEven(x) {
    if(x % 2 == 0) return true;
    else return false;
}

function isOdd(x) {
    if(x % 2 == 1) return true;
    else return false;
}

filter(evenNumbers, isEven) => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
filter(evenNumbers, isOdd)  => []
filter(oddNumbers, isEven)  => []
filter(oddNumbers, isOdd)   => [3, 5, 7, 9]
filter(someNumbers, isEven) => [2, 4]
filter(someNumbers, isOdd)  => [1, 3]
