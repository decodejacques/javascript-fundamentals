It has 2 parameters the first is a variable that is assigned an array the second is the function to be performed on it, so array, function (shocking since this is the HOF question).

what does it do, it loops though each item of the array and if isOdd returns all of the Odd characters and isEven will return all of the even numbers

Someone has given you a function called filter
You don't know what it does, but there are clues at the bottom of this file
Use these clues to describe what filter is.
Specifically:

 - How many parameters does it have
 - What are the types of the parameters
 - What does it do?



var evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
var oddNumbers = [3, 5, 7, 9];
var someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

function isEven(x) {
    if(x % 2 == 0) return true;
    else return false;
}

function isOdd(x) {
    if(x % 2 == 1) return true;
    else return false;
}

filter(evenNumbers, isEven) => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
filter(evenNumbers, isOdd)  => []
filter(oddNumbers, isEven)  => []
filter(oddNumbers, isOdd)   => [3, 5, 7, 9]
filter(someNumbers, isEven) => [2, 4]
filter(someNumbers, isOdd)  => [1, 3]
