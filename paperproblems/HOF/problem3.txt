/* man I hate this abc shit

f(k) => f(g) where g is k so returns k(3,5), so i is 3 and j is 5 returns 3+2+5*2, 5*2 is 10 + 5 = 15

What is the output of this program? Don't cheat by running it!

function k(i, j) {
    return i + 2 + j * 2;
}

function f(g) {
    return g(3,5);
}

console.log(f(k));
