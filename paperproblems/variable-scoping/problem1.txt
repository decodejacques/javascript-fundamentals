What is the output of this program?

**********<ANSWER>**********
first call of f():    2
        (Returns: undefined)

second call of f():   4
        (Returns: undefined)

Why? 
Variable x is a closure
of function f. (Declared in
global scope; therefore
increments at every call.)
**********</ANSWER>*********

var x = 1;

function f() {
    x = x * 2;
    console.log(x);
}

f();
f();
