What is the output of this program?

**********<ANSWER>**********
first call of f():    2
        (Returns: undefined)

second call of f():   2
        (Returns: undefined)

Why?
Variable x is not a closure
of function f; it is
declared every time the
function runs and therefore,
the result is the same at
every call.
**********</ANSWER>*********

function f() {
    var x = 1;
    x = x * 2;
    console.log(x);
}

f();
f();
